Structured Indoor Modeling

Puslished in IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV2015)

This package contains the matlab implementation of the partial framework in the paper above. 

Useage:
1. Compile the mex files if necessary (Manually complie each mex file or simply run include/mex/source/script_build_mex.m)
You need to install Eigen library ("http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page") and put the installation path
2. Run run_apartment1.m or run_aparment2.m (you can use other dataset by changing these script and script/parameter_setup_floored.m)

Output:
- floorplan.ply (the recovered structured model in ply format); please see include/matlab/convert_floorplan_to_ply.m for more details
- floorplan.txt (the intermediate file that store the structured graph information); please see include/matlab/write_sructure_graph_basic.m for more details.
This file will be used for the future update (+detail reconstruction)

Note:
- Currently, the soure codes only recover the structured model without detail and object nodes (only recover the wall, floor, ceiling).
Other component will be added to the package later. 
- Our algorithm has a randomized process in the room segmentation step, therefore the result is not guaranteed to be same with the one in the paper.
- My code is only validated on Windows8 +ã€€Matlab2014b
